# MultiCloud DevOps & AI Challenge - Day 1

## Overview
This guide documents my learning journey from Day 1 of the MultiCloud DevOps & AI Challenge. The goal of this exercise was to leverage an AI assistant (Claude) to generate Terraform code, set up an AWS EC2 instance, install Terraform, and deploy infrastructure components including an S3 bucket and DynamoDB tables.

---

## Step 1: Using Claude to Generate Terraform Code


1. Start a chat with Claude.
2. Prompt Claude with the following request:
    
    ```plaintext
    Please provide Terraform code to create an S3 bucket on AWS with a unique name in the us-east-1 region.
    ```
3. Claude should generate code similar to:
    
    ```hcl
    provider "aws" {
      region = "us-east-1" # Replace with your desired region
    }
    
    resource "random_id" "bucket_suffix" {
      byte_length = 8
    }
    
    resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
      bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}"
      
      tags = {
        Name       = "My bucket"
        Environment = "Dev"
      }
    }
    ```
4. **Save this Terraform code** for later deployment.

## Step 2: Setting Up an EC2 Instance

1.  **Create a free AWS account** at [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). 
2.   Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
3.  Click "Roles" in the left sidebar, then "Create role".
4.  Choose "AWS service" as the trusted entity type and "EC2" as the use case.
5.  Search for and attach the "AdministratorAccess" policy. Note: In a production environment, use a more restricted policy.
6.  Name the role "EC2Admin" and provide a description.
7.  Review and create the role.
8. Open an **EC2 dashboard**.
9. Click on **"Launch Instance"**.
10. Create a new instance and name it **"workstation"**.
11. Choose **Amazon Linux 2 AMI** as the machine image.
12. Select the **t2.micro** instance type.
13. Configure instance details:
    - Network: Default VPC
    - Subnet: Any available
    - Auto-assign Public IP: **Enable**
    - IAM Role: Select the EC2 Admin role you created.
14. Keep default storage settings.
15. Add a tag: `Key = "Name"`, `Value = "workstation"`.
16. Create a security group named **"launch-wiz-1"**.
17. **Uncheck** "Allow SSH traffic from" initially.
18. Review and launch the instance, creating a **key pair** named **"key-cloudmart"**.
19. The instance will show "running" but may take 1-2 minutes to fully initialize.

## Step 3: Connecting to EC2 and Installing Terraform

1. From the **EC2 dashboard**, select your **workstation** instance.
2. Click **"Connect"** and use the **EC2 Instance Connect** method.
3. If connection fails, add an **inbound rule** to the security group "launch-wiz-1":
    - Type: Custom TCP
    - Port Range: Any (or 22 for SSH if desired)
    - Source: 0.0.0.0/0
4. Try connecting again in a fresh window (close any previous error windows).
5. In the SSH session, update system packages:
    
    ```bash
    sudo yum update -y
    ```
6. Install `yum-utils`:
    
    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y yum-utils
    ```
7. Add the HashiCorp repository:
    
    ```bash
    sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo [https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo](https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo)
    ```
8. Install Terraform:
    
    ```bash
    sudo yum -y install terraform
    ```
9. Verify the installation:
    
    ```bash
    terraform version
    ```

## Step 4: Deploying Terraform Configuration

1. **Create a new directory** and navigate to it:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project
    ```
2. Create and open the Terraform configuration file:
    
    ```bash
    nano main.tf
    ```
3. Paste the Terraform code generated by Claude.
4. Save and exit (in nano, press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).
5. Initialize Terraform:
    
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
6. Review the execution plan:
    
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```
7. Apply the configuration:
    
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
8. Type **"yes"** when prompted to create the resources.

## Step 5: Verifying S3 Bucket Creation

1. Use the AWS CLI to list the created buckets:
    
    ```bash
    aws s3 ls
    ```
2. Confirm that your newly created S3 bucket appears in the list.


---

## Step 6: Creating DynamoDB Tables

Replace the S3 bucket configuration in `main.tf` with the following DynamoDB table definitions:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  
}

# DynamoDB Tables
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "cloudmart_products" {
  name          = "cloudmart-products"
  billing_mode  = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key      = "id"

  attribute {
    name = "id"
    type = "S"
  }
}

resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "cloudmart_orders" {
  name          = "cloudmart-orders"
  billing_mode  = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key      = "id"

  attribute {
    name = "id"
    type = "S"
  }
}

resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "cloudmart_tickets" {
  name          = "cloudmart-tickets"
  billing_mode  = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key      = "id"


  attribute {
    name = "id"
    type = "S"
  }
}

```

1. **Apply the configuration**:
   
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
2. Type **"yes"** when prompted to create the resources.

## Conclusion

On Day 1, I successfully leveraged Claude AI to generate Terraform code, set up an EC2 instance, installed Terraform, and deployed AWS resources. This hands-on experience provided valuable insight into Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and AWS service provisioning.

Next Steps:
- Explore additional Terraform configurations.
- Automate deployments using CI/CD pipelines.
- Extend AI-driven automation for DevOps tasks.
