# Multicloud DevOps & AI Challenge

## Context
CloudMart, an e-commerce company, is facing significant IT efficiency issues and rising costs related to customer support. These challenges have directly impacted the company's competitiveness, which is losing market share to Klarna, a competitor that offers the same products at lower prices.

To solve these problems, CloudMart seeks to implement innovative solutions based on DevOps and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize operations, reduce costs, and increase its competitiveness.

## Challenge: Phase 1
### Objective
Identify and propose a strategy for implementing AI assistants that optimize customer support, ensuring cost reduction and maintaining quality of service.

### Problems to Solve
- High customer support costs.
- Low operational efficiency.
- Reduced competitiveness in the market.

### Initial Proposal
- Use AI assistants to perform most of the customer service.
- Ensure that assistants are capable of handling at least 90% of interactions.

## Decisions: Phase 2
### Operational Results
- AI assistants now handle 90% of customer service.
- Support staff was reduced from 500 people to 50 supervisors, resulting in the layoff of 450 employees.

### Financial Impact
- Monthly payroll was reduced from $2.5 million to $250,000.
- The company's monthly profit increased by $2.25 million.

### Future Challenges
- Ensure the quality of automated service.
- Evaluate the organizational impact of layoffs.
- Expand the solution to other areas of the company.

## Instructions
Create a detailed plan for implementing the AI-based solution, including:

- Tools and technologies that will be used.
- Training and deployment strategy for assistants.
- Metrics to measure the impact on support and costs.
- Present proposals to mitigate the negative impacts of layoffs on the organizational environment.
- Propose ways to expand the use of AI in other operational areas of CloudMart to maximize efficiency and competitiveness gains.
